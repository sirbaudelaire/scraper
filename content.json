I won't be using it. I looked at it and it seems to have a lot of buttons to play with, but it would not replace my wireless small mouse that just fits my hand.I would recommend this if you're looking for a decent backlit keyboard.

            "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
            "body": "Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the \"you get what you pay for\" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange \"tall\" type that relocates the \"\\\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. \"#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?\" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... \"What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return\". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice."

I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30.

That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease.

            "body": "Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the \"you get what you pay for\" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange \"tall\" type that relocates the \"\\\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. \"#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?\" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... \"What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return\". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice."

I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it.

That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease.

            "body": "Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the \"you get what you pay for\" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange \"tall\" type that relocates the \"\\\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. \"#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?\" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... \"What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return\". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice."

I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it.

That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease.

            "body": "Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the \"you get what you pay for\" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange \"tall\" type that relocates the \"\\\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. \"#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?\" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... \"What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return\". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice."

First, the package was way too big to fit inside a mailbox (obviously) but it also could not fit inside a parcel mailbox either, and I was forced to retrieve it from the post office. Items like this are better sent via Amazon's own delivery service, or Fedex, etc. USPS is not designed to deliver large packages. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase."

            "body": "Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the \"you get what you pay for\" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange \"tall\" type that relocates the \"\\\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. \"#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?\" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... \"What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return\". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice."

It's not a slim keyboard like the junky ones you get with your new computer. If it were a boat, I'd call it beamy.What I like:It lights up. Pick a color or do what I'm trying and just leaving it at all colors. My eyes feel less strained using the mix.It's quiet without being mushy. The keys feel like and old typewriter if anyone out there is old enough to recall those. It makes for very easy typing.That it's not wireless. I like a wireless mouse, but a wireless keyboard is not worth it to me since I'm not actually dragging the wire around like I would with a mouse. Nothing to eat more batteries.What I don't like:The back row of keys do not light up. Not that I have much use for any of them, but it seems weird that they made it so they cannot be seen in the dark.So far, the likes outweigh the don't likes.The mouse. No clue on that. I won't be using it. I looked at it and it seems to have a lot of buttons to play with, but it would not replace my wireless small mouse that just fits my hand.I would recommend this if you're looking for a decent backlit keyboard. I do have it on a sliding keyboard tray with the back props up and it still has room to slide away. The measurements were not given in the specs so I wasn't sure it would work, but it does."
